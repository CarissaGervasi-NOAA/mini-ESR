# GOM-sst
Mean monthly sea surface temperature (SST) standardized anomalies over the Gulf of Mexico for the mini ecosystem status report. The data are [NOAA Optimum Interpolated 0.25 degree daily SST Ver. 2.1](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/optimum-interpolation-sst) averaged into monthly means. Then the longterm monthly means and standard deviations were calculated using data from 1982 to 2010. These were used to calculate the standardized anomalies.

[Original code](https://github.com/Gulf-IEA/GOM-sst) to download data from ERDDAP, subset, create anomalies and figure.
